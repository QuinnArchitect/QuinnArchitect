# 🧩 Quinn — The Process Flow Architect  

### 🌿 About Quinn
I start by **listening and reading**.  
Every team already has the details of how they work — in people’s heads, in notes, checklists, guides, and old documents.  

I **gather those scattered pieces** and organize them into a clear process flowchart that everyone can see and understand.  

From there, we work together to **review, adjust, and refine** each step until the process feels accurate and complete.  
When we’re done, the team has one shared, documented way of working that makes sense to everyone.

### 🪶 Current Project
**[Flowchart Formula](https://github.com/FlowchartFormula)** —  
an open repository of visual frameworks, templates, and documentation formulas for modern teams.
